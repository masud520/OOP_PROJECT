# Examination Processing System - Java Project

## Project Description
This Java program is designed to process examination results for a university department. It allows for the input of student details and subject scores, calculates averages and grades according to the Strathmore University grading system, and generates comprehensive report cards.

## Features
- Records student details (name and ID number) for at least 10 students
- Accepts score input for at least 5 subjects per student
- Calculates average scores and determines grades
- Generates detailed report cards including:
  - Student name and ID
  - All subjects and their scores
  - Average score and grade
  - Performance recommendation
  - Current date

## Group Members
1. [Member 1 192255-ABDI MASUD] - [1.Student class and core data structure
   2.Input/Output methods and validation
   Grading calculations and report generation]


## Technologies Used
- Java Programming Language
- Object-Oriented Programming principles


## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Java JDK installed on your system
2. Compile the program:
   
   javac ExaminationSystem.java
   
3. Run the program:
   
   java ExaminationSystem
   
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter student data and view reports

## Project Structure
- ExaminationSystem.java: Main program class containing the entry point and primary logic
- Student.java: Student class that handles student data and calculations
- (Additional files if you expand the project)

## Grading System Implementation
The program implements the following grading scale based on Strathmore University standards:
- A: 75-100
- B: 60-69
- C: 50-59
- D: 40-49
- F: Below 40

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add file persistence to save/load student records
- [ ] Implement input validation for scores (0-100 range)
- [ ] Develop a graphical user interface
- [ ] Add support for different grading systems
- [ ] Include statistical analysis of class performance
